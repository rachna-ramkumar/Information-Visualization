      <h2><u>Question</u>:What are the top 10 purposes of
disbursements (in terms of total amount of disbursement) and how does their
relative amount compare over time? E.g., are there purposes that tend to be
prominent for a period of time and others that become more prominent during other
periods?</h2><br/>
    <h2><u>Explanation</u>:For this visualization, we can also use a stacked Area Chart with all the top 10 Coalesced
Purposes, on the same chart. Since we're going to represent all purposes together, it will
be hard for us to distinguish amongst each of them, and so to make sure we can
differentiate amongst each one of them quickly, we will represent each purpose with a
unique color. To visualize the given problem statement on a stacked area chart, we will
represent the time on the x-axis and the amount change on the y-axis. For Example, refer
a sample chart below,
    <br /><br />
    <u>PROS</u>:Since we are using one graph for all of the top 10 purposes, we can easily save
space and also will be able to spot out the comparison between one another more
evidently.<br /><br />
    <u>CONS</u>: Again, since there are too many countries it becomes confusing when there are too many bars on the chart.<br /><br />
    <u>SOLVED</u>: Analyzing the dataset and pre-processing it to scale it to visualize into this chart is
tricky and challenging also, mainly because we will have to split them based on the
purposes and identify only the top 10 of those. Although, since we are representing all of
them together, we can spot the peaks more visibly than the first solution mentioned.
